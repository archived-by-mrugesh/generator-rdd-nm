# generator-rdd-nm

> Scaffold out a node module, but with additional goodies.

This is based of the awesome work by [Sindre Sorhus][sindre-github-url]'s on his [generator-nm][generator-nm-url], and [Kent C. Dodds][kentcdodds-github-url]'s on his [generator-kcd-oss][generator-kcd-oss-url].

## Installation and Usage

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) installed, run

```
$ npm install -g yeoman generator-rdd-nm
$ mkdir my-project && cd my-project
$ yo rdd-nm
```

Follow the prompts from there.

## Acknowledgments

generator-rdd-nm was inspired by [generator-nm][generator-nm-url] and [generator-kcd-oss][generator-kcd-oss-url], I admit that I could not resists copying off from the great work done by these awesome people.
